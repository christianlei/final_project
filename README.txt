Predicting Bitcoin with Machine Learning in 5 Different Programming Languages

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate the similarities and differences between the implemtation of a Logistic Regression Machine Learning model. To implement our project there are two parts, the data cleaning portion and the machine learning model. These were implemented in 5 languages, Python, Java, C++, Rust and Go. 

This ReadMe details how to run our program in each of the 5 programming languages.

Python
